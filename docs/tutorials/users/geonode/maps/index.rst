Managing Maps
=============

The next primary component of GeoNode is the **map**. Maps are comprised of various layers and their styles. The Layers can be either local, served by the local GeoServer or remote, served by other map service providers such as Open Street Map, Google, Bing or MapQuest. 

The GeoNode Map viewer provides tools for map navigation, layers management, ordering and styling, identifying features, etc.

In this section, we will create a map based on the layers uploaded in the previous section, combine them with some existing layers and a remote web service layer, and then share the resulted map for public viewing.
